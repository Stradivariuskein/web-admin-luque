rem vDos has some configuration options, you eventually set those in this file.
rem Don't try to include DOS config.sys or Windows config.nt settings like FILES= or KEYB=, that won't work!

rem Options and parameters are case insensitive. Spaces are ignored.
rem [parameter] means the parameter is optional.


REM Keyboard and mouse
REM ==================
rem Ctrl+V pastes text from the Windows Clipboard. If your program however uses Ctrl+V itself:
rem CTRL+V = OFF

rem Extend the copy to Windows clipboard functionality. See the last section in Printing.pdf for details:
rem COPYCLIP = LPT5

rem To change a reported keypress, specify the current and new hexadecimal scan/ASCII codes.
rem For instance to change a numpad comma to the decimal point:
rem KEYCODE = 532C=342E

rem In text mode the mouse is disabled.
rem Some DOS programs just handle the mouse badly (able to leave the window), to turn it on:
rem MOUSE = ON


REM Font
REM ====
rem Text is displayed by a built-in scalable TTF font, optimized for DOS programs.
rem To use another (monospaced) font, copy the font file (consola.ttf...) to the vDos folder, then:
rem FONT = CONSOLA.TTF
rem Or more directly, for Windows installed fonts:
rem FONT = C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\CONSOLA
rem If no file extension is supplied, TTF is assumed.

rem DOS ASCII codes 176-223 mostly display a mix of lines/boxes and extended characters.
rem If characters are displayed while you expect lines/boxes, enforce those by the optional minus sign:
rem FONT = -[BOLD, WIDE or font file]
rem BOLD will select the bold typeface of the internal font, WIDE a little wider one.


REM Window
REM ======
rem The default vDos window is centered and will cover about (max) 50% of the screen.
rem This can be changed by WINDOW = [-][size%][,horz%:vert%]
rem In text mode, the window has some extra blank space to the left and right, the minus sign will disable this.
rem Horz% and vert%: 0 means window is aligned to the left/top, 100 to the right/bottom.
rem The next line would give a full screen view. Mind, it's still a window (in disguise), so won't obscure Windows notifications:
rem WINDOW = 100
rem Alternatively, you can use Alt+Enter to switch to and back from full screen.

rem The number of lines and columns in text mode is the standard DOS 25x80.
rem See for yourself if changing this (minimal 24x80) is useful and supported by your program, for instance:
rem TEXT = 30x100

rem Text is displayed in the standard DOS colors. You can change those by THEME = [DARK][+][-][0 to 9]:
rem THEME = 2
rem DARK sets a dark mode for the vDos window.
rem To change the underline cursor to a block, add a plus sign.
rem The cursor is displayed in complementary colors. For the traditional switching of fore- and background colors, add a minus sign.


REM WordPerfect/WordStar
REM ====================
rem The WP = directive is specific for use of WordPerfect.
rem Documentation can be found at: http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/vdoswp.html.


REM Printing
REM ========
rem Without explicit settings, printing should mostly work just fine.
rem If not, or you want more control over the printer's output: See the Printing.pdf document for the options.
