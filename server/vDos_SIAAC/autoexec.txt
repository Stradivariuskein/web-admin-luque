rem This is essentially the DOS autoexec.bat.
rem =========================================

rem At startup, C: is the only drive letter known by vDos.
rem By default it is assigned to the folder of vDos.exe.

rem Note this vDos/DOS C: is commonly NOT Windows C: !
rem vDos drive letters don't have to match those of Windows.
rem It's even adviced they don't, to limit access to the Windows file system.

rem The USE command assigns vDos drive letters to Windows drives, folders,
rem or network shares. The command syntax is:
rem USE <vDos drive letter:> <Windows path>\
rem Examples: USE C: D:\dosprog\, USE F: \\server\share\dosprog\.

rem Execute the batch file that launches the DataPerfect TestDrive demo program:
CALL DPTEST\STARTDP.BAT

@echo off
rem The demo program and batch file ended, so we return here.
rem Edit this file to launch your DOS program as vDos starts.
rem Eventually add a last EXIT command to close the vDos window.
